# 2. What is Machine Learning?

*”Artificial Intelligence? Machine Learning? I don’t care - it’s taking my job and it’s taking over the world!”.* 

A side note: I won’t be getting into the details of the different types of machine learning (supervised vs unsupervised), classification vs regression, etc. However, I wanted to write about this topic because I see a lot of people throwing the terms ‘AI’ and ‘machine learning’ carelessly. Also, it’s one of the few opportunities in which data science crosses with philosophy, which is right up my ally. 

There are a few ways to explain machine learning. Whether it be in science-fiction movies, CNN, or the crazy guy on the street claiming that the world’s going to end, everyone has heard of these terms and have a faint idea of what it is. I’ll start off by distinguishing between _Machine Learning_ and _Artificial Intelligence_, because the mix-up between these two terms is every data scientist’s pet peeve. 

The mix-up isn’t really anyone’s fault. A quick google search of ‘artificial intelligence’ already gives you contradictory information:
- _“Intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals” -_ [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence)
- _“Concerned with building smart machines capable of performing tasks that require human intelligence” -_ [builtin](https://builtin.com/artificial-intelligence)
- *“Simulation of human intelligence in machines that are programmed to think like humans and mimic their actions”* - [investopedia]

The distinction I like to use is Philosopher Ken Taylor’s “AI-as-cognitive-science” vs “AI-as-engineering” from his [article](http://bostonreview.net/science-nature-philosophy-religion/kenneth-taylor-robots-are-coming) “The Robots are Coming.” The similarity between the two types of AI is that they are algorithms that can compute logical statements significantly faster than humans can. In turn, we build and use these algorithms to solve mathematical statements, predict data points, and create programs that can mimic certain human behaviours. 

However, Taylor argues that AI can be divided between ‘AI-as-cognitive-science’ and ‘AI-as-engineering’. The former type of AI are sets of algorithms that attempt to mimic the human brain in a way so that the ultimate goal is encompass the entirety of how humans think. For example, AI-as-cognitive-science  In contrast, ‘AI-as-engineering’ are sets of algorithms that is designed to solve large and complex problems for industry applications. This type of AI (which I consider machine learning) is concerned with predicting data points when given a library of historical data points and is not designed to mimic the complex system of cognitive processes that we possess. 

What does this have to do with AI and machine learning? I think that there’s a large group of people who believe AI encompasses the definition of AI-as-cognitive science. And as I’ve mentioned - I consider machine learning to be AI-as-engineering.

So to recap: AI that can eventually gain consciousness and co-exist with our world? That’s the eventual goal for AI-as-cognitive-science. AI that can classify thousands of data points so I can know if the soccer team I support really does suck? That’s AI-as-engineering, or also known as machine learning.

**What about deep learning?** This is a topic that I won’t get into too much in this post, because it deserves a whole other post (or a whole other field of study - cognitive science & the philosophy of mind). But briefly put, deep learning is the field of study where you try to simulate the way humans think to build better machine learning models. However, the question to ask is this: *If you could completely simulate the brain using computers and algorithms, would you be able to recreate consciousness? * If you want to read more about this, check out philosopher John Searle’s *Minds, Brains, and Programs* - a response to Alan Turing’s Turing test. This [paper](https://philpapers.org/archive/MARCAM-4) does a good job summarizing the whole philosophical battle between the two.
