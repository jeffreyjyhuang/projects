# Jeffrey Huang - Projects

## About

This is a repository that I have created to track my progress in Data Science related topics in order to organise my knowledge and goals. Feel free to head to my blog at [jeffrey-huang.ca](https://jeffrey-huang.ca) to see more.

## Premier League 
- [Premier League Insights](https://github.com/jeffreyjyhuang/projects/tree/master/premier_league):
	- [Cleaning and Sraping TransferMarkt Data](https://github.com/jeffreyjyhuang/projects/blob/master/premier_league/1_scraping_transfermarkt.ipynb): Scraped www.transfermarkt.com using BeautifulSoup. I created a function that can scrape any soccer team. Compiled a dataset with the twenty teams from the 2020-2021 Premier League.

## Restaurant Data
- [Predicting Restaurant Success](https://github.com/jeffreyjyhuang/restaurant-demographics): Scraped Statistics Canada census data and extracted Yelp's Public Dataset to predict restaurant success with demographic data. Focused on restuarants in Downtown Toronto. 
	- [Cleaning and Extracting Census Data](https://github.com/jeffreyjyhuang/restaurant-demographics/blob/master/Demographic_Data_Cleaning.ipynb): Used Statistics Canada API to extract relevant data. Contains some EDA and feature engineering.
	- [Cleaning and Extracting Restaurant Data](https://github.com/jeffreyjyhuang/restaurant-demographics/blob/master/Restaurant_Data_Cleaning.ipynb): Extracted and filtered down Yelp's public dataset. Contains some EDA and feature engineering.
	- [Feature Engineering](https://github.com/jeffreyjyhuang/restaurant-demographics/blob/master/Modelling_Data_Cleaning.ipynb): Final touches on feature engineering and preparing data for modelling.
	- [Modelling with Scikit-Learn](https://github.com/jeffreyjyhuang/restaurant-demographics/blob/master/Modelling_Data_Cleaning.ipynb): Deployed appropriate models, grid searching, and model selection.
