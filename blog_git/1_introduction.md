# 1. Introduction

_What is this, and who is it for?_

This is a first of a (large) series of posts that explore the ins and outs of machine learning. The world of data science is constantly changing, and when you’re trying to adapt to new skills, you often make room in your brain for these shiny new techniques. And when you’re prompted to revisit an old topic, you might have need to take some time to flip over some notes to familiarize yourself. 

This blog is meant to be those notes — a series of posts that will provide the foundations to machine learning. I won’t be proving every single theorem (only the fun ones), but I promise I won’t leave any theorem unexplained. Every post will investigate a particular concept. It’ll start with something theoretical - an investigation of a particular intuition or theory. Then, it’ll move towards something more tangible and applied, often paired with datasets that I’m particularly fond of. I’ll do most of this in Python, but don’t be too alarmed if you see the occasional R posts. 

This blog is mostly for myself, but I’m hoping that it can be as helpful as it is to me, to anyone who also stumbles across this. These posts will be adapted from various sources, including: 
- O’Rielly’s _Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow_
- Andiry Burkov’s *The Hundred-Page Machine Learning Book*
